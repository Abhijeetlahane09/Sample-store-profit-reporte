# Sample-store-profit-reporte

ðŸŽ¯ Created a Superstore Profit Report using Power BI:

ðŸ‘‰ Insights:
1. How the profit of the superstore varies with the Category, Region, and Segment.
2. How the profit and sales vary in each state every year and every quarter.
3. How much quantity is being sold of each category and sub-category state-wise every year/quarter.

ðŸ‘‰ Charts involved:
1. Pie Chart
2. Donut Chart
3. Line Chart
4. Stacked Bar Chart

âœ’ The report is made dynamic by the appropriate use of Slicers for end-user interaction.
âœ’ Matrix made it easier to display the profit numbers region wise.
âœ’ Displaying the Overall sales,profit and quantity using Cards.

I really enjoyed preparing and customizing the report.
